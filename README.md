# Joining Data with Pandas
Project from DataCamp in which the skills needed to join data sets with Pandas based on a key variable are put to the test.

The main goal of this project is to ensure the ability to join numerous data sets using the Pandas library in Python. This is done through a reference variable that depending on the application is kept intact or reduced to a smaller number of observations. The evaluation of these skills takes place through the completion of a series of tasks presented in the jupyter notebook in this repository.

_The project tasks were developed by the platform DataCamp and they were completed by Brayan Orjuela_
